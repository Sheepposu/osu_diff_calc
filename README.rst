WARNING: Diff calc is not working nor is it updated, however values calculated using solely the performance calculator should be correct. 
If you are looking for a way to get a beatmap's difficulty attributes without manually calculating it, you can use api v2. Consider checking out my
`osu.py <https://github.com/Sheepposu/osu.py>`_ library, a Python api wrapper for osu api v2.

Library for doing difficulty and pp calculations for beatmaps. Works well with my `beatmap_reader <https://github.com/Sheepposu/beatmap_reader>`_ library.
